Major Update (with 3 more titles)

This release is a significant rewrite of a lot of the extension and the parsing utility.

I rewrote the extension popup window, changed parts of the options windows, and added dark mode. Added power rangers
emotes. And added a smoother check for VLC.

Up to this point I had three separate scripts (one for each marathon, and an analysis 
tool). Each took a different format that was designed to facilitate solving the problem I had at the moment,
but integrating these made getting a consistent result from the various input files overly complex. Now 
the utility has a general and easily extensible way to input new shows, which should work well for future marathons.

Added the RWBY marathon in its entierty.
Added JOKER GAME, Yuri on Ice, and Anne Happy!
