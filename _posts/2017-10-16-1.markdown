RWBY + VLC Update

Near the conclusion of the RWBY marathon I had plans to update the extension with RWBY episodes. But while watching I realized
it was going to be troublesome to sync playback for the viewer because the marathon skips the intro in many episodes (and it's not exactly
consistent across volumes). So it wouldn't be obvious at what point in the episode to start chat. This in addition to the
shorter episiodes meant that comparitively more time would be spent setting up the chat.

To remedy this I decided to add VLC support. VLC supports control over it's HTTP interface, which is what I would use.

RWBY had a different format from the other anime marathons, so I needed to change the parsing script, in addition I needed
to add support for alternate episodes. These changes meant that version 0.9.4 only had support for RWBY Vol 1, the previous
anime hadn't been updated yet and were not available in this release.

This was a testing release with all of RWBY Vol 1, with alternates 1-4.

Some added features:
Seek bar, chat mentions, support for :<name>: emojis, added the name highlight feature.
