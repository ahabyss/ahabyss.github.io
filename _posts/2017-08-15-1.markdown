First Replay (Mob Psycho)

I never got the chat bot method to work well because I couldn't directly pass username and color 
information. This version did successfully connect to the ChatController and sendMessage(). To format a
message this function pulls username and color information from an array in a tmiRoom object. It is possible to display a message
with a desired color and username by editing this array between each call to sendMessage(), but the result is separate 
messages sharing usernames/colors (I think because Ember posts messages in groups, and only querys the tmiRoom UserContainer
once).

Nevertheless it worked, was able to load the parsed json files, and play them back. I rewatched the 4 episodes of Mob Psycho 100 that I had missed.
