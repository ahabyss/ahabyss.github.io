Before it had a name or any plans to be an extension. 

The initial idea was to download and parse logs from overrustle, and then build some kind of video player 
plugin or stand alone application using the parsed data. The first parsing analysis code was written in MATLAB.

Early on I realized a browser extension would make it easiest to use so that's where I focused.

I only spent a day before moving to python for parsing. MATLAB is great for executing quickly on non demanding projects, but
with datafiles in the 100s of MB it is unweildy and slow.

My initial instinct was to essentially make a twitch chat bot, that would sever the socket to the server, and send
messages to chat by hooking some function and passing each chat message data. These messages would in theory be displayed 
perfectly because twitch was doing the formatting (these formatting scripts are local).
