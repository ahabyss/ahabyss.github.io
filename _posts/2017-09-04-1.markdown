Addition of "Ojisan and Marshmellow" and "Akashic Records"

This updated added the ability to input a custom delay, and I also two anime titles.

Ojisan and Marshmellow because it is one of three anime without mid-episode breaks, I wanted to get the
parser to work on both types. And Akashic Records because it is one of my favorites from the marathon.
