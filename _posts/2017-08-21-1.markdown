First Release. Core functionality complete.

This was virtually a complete rewrite of the chat replay window. The previous version played in the extension popup bubble.
Meaning if you clicked in that browser tab the chat would lose all progress. Another major change I wanted was to no longer
rely on twitch, and instead do all processing built in for complete control. Fortunately reChat, 
BTTV and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/global-twitch-emotes/pgniedifoejifjkndekolimjeclnokkb?hl=en">globaltwitchemotes.com</a> are open source and helped me get a draft version up and running quickly.

I wanted to add badges to make the chat feel more like twitch, so I added random badges, but I wanted a way to turn 
this off. So I added the options page. And added the control panel to the app so you didn't need to play via console.

I added a default 2 second smooth to all chat messages, so they will be evenly spaced.

The emote api sites (twitchemotes.com) don't support the TwitchPresents emotes, so I added those.

Also changed page load to use promises, so I don't need to call a timeout.

The 12 episodes of Mob Pyscho were in this release.
